# CoreDHCP configuration (yaml)

# In this file, lines starting with "## " represent default values,
# while uncommented lines are examples which have no default value

# The base level configuration has two sections, one for each protocol version
# (DHCPv4 and DHCPv6). There is no shared configuration at the moment.
# At a high level, both accept the same structure of configuration

# DHCPv6 configuration

# DHCPv4 configuration
server4:
    # listen is an optional section to specify how the server binds to an
    # interface or address.
    # If unset, the server will listen on the broadcast address on all
    # interfaces, equivalent to:
    listen:
        - "%vlanbr0"
    #    - "%lan2.100"

    # In general, listen takes a list of addresses, with the general syntax
    # "address%interface:port", where each part is optional.
    # * Omitting the address results in the wildcard address being used
    # * Omitting the interface skips binding the listener to a specific interface
    #   and listens on all interfaces instead
    # * Omitting the port uses the default port for DHCPv4 (67)
    #
    # For example:
    # - ":44480" Listens on a specific port.
    # - "%eno1" Listens on the wildcard address on one interface.
    # - "192.0.2.1%eno1:44480" with all parts

    # plugins is a mandatory section, which defines how requests are handled.
    # It is a list of maps, matching plugin names to their arguments.
    # The order is meaningful, as incoming requests are handled by each plugin
    # in turn. There is no default value for a plugin configuration, and a
    # plugin that is not mentioned will not be loaded at all
    #
    # The following contains examples of the most common, builtin plugins.
    # External plugins should document their arguments in their own
    # documentations or readmes
